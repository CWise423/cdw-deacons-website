    <h1>Happy Birthday Deacon!</h1>
    <p>
      This may look like an empty website, but it is the gift that keeps on
      giving. This is a project that I would like to work on with you and we can
      make it about whatever you want!
    </p>
    <p>If you want to add a picture of a cat...</p>
    <img
      src="https://cdn.freecodecamp.org/curriculum/cat-photo-app/relaxing-cat.jpg"
      alt="cute cat"
    />
    <p>we can do that!</p>

    <h3>I love you so much and I can't wait to work on this with you!</h3>

    <p>
      Call me when you get this website link and let me know what you think.
